# House-price-prediction-Cross-Validation---Linear-Regression
This notebook demonstrates how to do cross-validation (CV) with linear regression as an example.We will mainly use `sklearn` to do cross-validation.
This notebook is divided into the following parts:
0. Experiments to understand overfitting
1. Building a linear regression model without cross-validation
2. Cross-validation in `sklearn`:
    - 2.1 K-fold CV 
    - 2.2 Hyperparameter tuning using CV
